I could read the mind of the jew, know what he's planning, then use my telekinesis to expel him effortlessly for the 110th time. https://twitter.com/theonlyspursfan/status/1260169371365883904

Then it all comes true. They tell us in advance so that by the time they roll out the newest form of mass-control, the masses have already forgotten. Plenty of distraction is provided too.

They'll lift the quarantine for a minute, give people a false sense of relief, then BLAM. Full-on martial law come winter. They already said coronachan will be twice as bad. That's basically an admission of intent.

Thank you. 🤗  Kinda dumb to lift a lockdown and still keep it in place. 😏 These people are retarded. I wonder if compliance is voluntary. Maybe they did it so they could just leave the "rules" in place permanently. Keep people from talking, waking up.
