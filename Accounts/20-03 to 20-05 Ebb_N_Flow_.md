No man comes unto the Father but by me."  The first Christians called themselves followers of 'The Way'. 😊

We have to find a solution that fits the here and now. Our present circumstances are not the same as they were before. Different times call for different measures.

He was very wealthy and owned many tin and metal mines in the British Isles. He was a very important man, which would explain why his request for Christ's body was granted. See the Gospel of Nicodemus.

It's certainly done a number on me. Plus the two hour time-zone difference. Still having trouble with that one. Lol. I miss my espresso. Gonna have to invest in a decent espresso machine. 😁☕
