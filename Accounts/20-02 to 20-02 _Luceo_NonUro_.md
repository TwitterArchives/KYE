They call it a "heirarchy".  This false-doctrine makes Christ's death on the cross of none effect. If everyone can be saved, then what need is there for Jesus? Complete blasphemy. pic.twitter.com/vf1G6NC7lh

Jesus spoke Galilean Aramaic, which is not Hebrew.  His name is Eshoa BAR Euseph  There is no Y or J in Aramaic.  No one in first century Judea or Galilee spoke Hebrew.

Paul was a Judahite of the tribe of Benjamin, from Tarsus in Cilicia.  The word 'jew' comes from the word 'Judean'. All residents of Judea, be they Edomites, Samaritans, Egyptians, etc, were called 'Ioudaios' (jews).

It's makes me tired.  How many people get infected with the flu in the US every year? How many die from it. I'm betting the numbers are similar to "coronavirus".

Ad hominem is your last resort as a jew who's been put in its place. Sorry. That doesn't work here.   Love your new glow-in-the-dark page for White hook-ups.   At least now everyone else knows what you are. Thanks for that. ü§£

They claim the Old Testament and the New Testament are one. Lol. Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament. It was made obsolete once the kingdom of God was established in 70 AD.  Written before 70 AD üëá pic.twitter.com/SVtwfyK0c5

You know what that means? They can't be saved. "The kingdom of God will be TAKEN from you and given to a nation (Gentiles) who WILL bear fruit."

"well, it's unchristian to treat them that way. We're supposed to love our neighbor." 'Love your neighbor' does not mean let him forcefully enter your home, make himself comfortable, rape your wife, and destroy everything you own, does it?
