This included all of Edom, who had been forcibly assimilated by John Hyrcanus.  Jesus was called a Nazarene (Matthew 2:23), not a jew, for a reason.  https://archive.org/details/originofthewordjew2

The Bible was written in Greek. The Greek word 'Ioudaios' means 'Judean', which is where the word 'jew' comes from; a word that didn't even exist until the 18th century. It does NOT mean 'Judah'.

They take over the roads way up in the mountains and stop anyone driving up there. White people fetch a huge ransom, so they kidnap them pretty often. Nothing like staring down a grenade-covered guerrilla with an AK-47 in your face.

My dad used to keep a few thousand dollars on him just to bribe the guerrillas with.   Of course, that was to bribe them into letting us go. More like ransom money.
