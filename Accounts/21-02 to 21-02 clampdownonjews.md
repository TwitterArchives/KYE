I can sense a jew's presence before I ever lay eyes on the filthy demon.  Not a drop of jew-blood gets in.  NO QUARTER.  NO EXCEPTIONS.

Rewarding good behavior produces much better results than scolding bad behavior. Teach him using small treats. Before long, good behavior will become second nature. :)

The original OT was written in Chaldee/Aramaic. They refer to God as Moryo Aloho, and Christ as Eshoa.   I wasn't trying to argue. Just wanted to know if you had looked into it. :)
